# Lecture notes


### EPFL Computer Science Bachelor


## Remark
I used Joachim Favre's style file for those notes [GitHub](https://github.com/JoachimFavre/UniversityNotes/tree/master). All the course doesn't belong to me, the explanation and most of the images belongs to the courses.

# Notes
#### Bachelor semester 1 (Autumn 2024)
For the first semeestrer, I used overleaf to take my notes.
- [Overleaf AICC I](https://www.overleaf.com/read/httyzkgthpwd#14e403)  | [AICC_quiz_1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511443/AICC_quiz_1.pdf)

- [Overleaf Algèbre linéaire](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jghqdrzjrdxz#79162c) | [Chapter__Review_Notes.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511445/Chapter__Review_Notes.pdf)



### Bachelor semester 2 (Spring 2025)
# Remark
During the second semester I changed my workflow, I now use neovim to write my notes and use snippets to allow me to go faster. All of this is possible because of Joachim Favre (again) and Gille Castel [How I manage my LaTeX notes](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-3/)

- [Overleaf Analyse II](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hcfrbrtbtkfq#d26d64) |  [Analyse_II_Prof__Lachowska_Anna_EPFL.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511446/Analyse_II_Prof__Lachowska_Anna_EPFL.pdf)


- [Overleaf AICC II](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rsgdckjsrrmf#3b69a9) | [AICC_II_Prof__Michael_Gastpar_EPFL.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511448/AICC_II_Prof__Michael_Gastpar_EPFL.pdf)


I stoped taking notes in FDS during the semester because of the enormous quantity of schema in this course which is note very "latex friendly"

- [Overlaf FDS](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mfknbgbbvfrf#8e97c6) |  [FDS_Prof__Mirjana_Stojilovic_EPFL.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511449/FDS_Prof__Mirjana_Stojilovic_EPFL.pdf) 

### Bachelor semester 3
- Computer Architecture - Prof. Paulo Ienne
