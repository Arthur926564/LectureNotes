# Lecture notes


### EPFL Computer Science Bachelor


## Remark
I used Joachim Favre's style file for those notes [GitHub](https://github.com/JoachimFavre/UniversityNotes/tree/master) with a bit of change here and there. All the courses materials doesn't belong to me, the explanation and most of the images belongs to the professors/labs, etc...

# Notes
#### Bachelor semester 1 (Autumn 2024)
For the first semester, I used overleaf to take my notes (yeah I know). 
- [Overleaf AICC I](https://www.overleaf.com/read/httyzkgthpwd#14e403)  | [AICC_quiz_1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511443/AICC_quiz_1.pdf)

- [Overleaf Algèbre linéaire](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jghqdrzjrdxz#79162c) | [Chapter__Review_Notes.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511445/Chapter__Review_Notes.pdf)

### Bachelor semester 2 (Spring 2025)
#### Remark
During the second semester I changed my workflow, I now use neovim to write my notes and use snippets to allow me to go faster. All of this is possible because of Joachim Favre (again) and Gille Castel [How I manage my LaTeX notes](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-3/)

- [Overleaf Analyse II](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hcfrbrtbtkfq#d26d64) |  [Analyse_II_Prof__Lachowska_Anna_EPFL.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511446/Analyse_II_Prof__Lachowska_Anna_EPFL.pdf)


- [Overleaf AICC II](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rsgdckjsrrmf#3b69a9) | [AICC_II_Prof__Michael_Gastpar_EPFL.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511448/AICC_II_Prof__Michael_Gastpar_EPFL.pdf)


I stoped taking notes in FDS during the semester because of the enormous quantity of schema in this course which is note very "latex friendly"

- [Overlaf FDS](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mfknbgbbvfrf#8e97c6) |  [FDS_Prof__Mirjana_Stojilovic_EPFL.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20511449/FDS_Prof__Mirjana_Stojilovic_EPFL.pdf) 

### Bachelor semester 3
for this course (which has the same number of schemas as in fds) I added a way to be able to transcript screenshot quickly into my tex file. To do so I used a [grim](https://github.com/emersion/grim) on arch linux.

### Contributing
If by any chance someone is reading this line and find a typo or want to contribute to the notes (i.e., the beginning of the first semester course are not in the notes, and the second part of fds is also not in the course) please send me a message or create an issue here!
