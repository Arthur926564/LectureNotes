\section*{Note before we begin}
This document is not a copy of all the materials of the course but more a summary that I will use for my revision.\\
Mistakes can also happens so if anyone is reading this, please be aware that if you think something is wrong, maybe it is. If you find a mistake you are more than welcome to send me a message or directly make a pull request on the repo \href{https://github.com/Arthur926564/LectureNotes}.

\begin{parag}{What is the course about}
	First the course is given by Prof. Wenzel which leads the \textit{Realistic Graphics Lab}. This lab research is on \textit{physically-based rendering} and \textit{inverse rendering}. The topics of this courses is used on a daily basis in their labs.\\
	But numerical methods is not only use in physics simulation. It is also used in:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Graphics
		\item Computer Vision
		\item Machine learning
		\item Computational Photography
		\item Weather simulation
		\item Geometric information systems
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{parag}
	\begin{parag}{Numerical Methods for rendering}
	    If we want to have a visual effects it comes down to solve an integral:\\
		for instance, to compute the color of a pixel it is computed as follow:
		\begin{align*} \text{pixel color} =  \int \text{light} dx \end{align*}
		If we want to compute the next frame of a simulation (a physics simulation) it comes down to solve an \important{enormous linear system}:
		\begin{align*} x =  A^{-1}b \end{align*}
		As we will see in the third homework, it can also be used for character animation. (we attach a virtual body to a skeleton usin optimization technique)
		\begin{align*} x = \underbrace{A^{+}}_{\text{Pseudoinverse}}b \end{align*}
		It is also used to computing derivatives of software for fun and profit (for maching learning), to do so we need to compute the partial derivative (or the hessian, jacobian, etc..) $\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x} $
	\end{parag}
	\begin{parag}{A certain feeling of familiarity}
	    So here all  the techniques we saw above, we already know them, we know them from MATH-111 or MATH-101, MATH-106. The goal of this course is to find a way to implement those abstract concept.
