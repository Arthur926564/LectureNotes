\begin{parag}{Compulsory Misses of a Direct Mapped Cache}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Given an initially empty \important{direct-mapped cache} with \important{4 lines} and \important{2 words per line}, find the total number of compulsory misses for the following memory access sequence (in decimal)
			\begin{align*} 12, 15, 11, 1, 17, 3, 17, 11, 17 \end{align*}
			\item The memory is word addressed
			\item The least recently used (LRU) replacement policy used
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Hits in a 2-Way Set-Associative}
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Given an initially empty \important{2-Way set associative cache} with \important{2 sets} and \important{4 words per block}, find the total number of hits for the following memory access sequence (in decimal):
			\begin{align*} 11, 15, 4, 16, 3, 10, 12, 24, 19, 25 \end{align*}
		\item The memory is word-addressed
		\item The least recently used (LRU) replacement policy is used
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{parag}
\begin{parag}{Miss Rate in a 2-Way Set-Associative}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Given an initially empty \important{2-way set associative cache} with \important{2 sets}, find the miss rate for the following \important{block address} access sequence (in decimal):
	\begin{align*} 6, 0, 0, 5, 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 0 \end{align*}
		\item	 The memory is word-addressed
		\item The least replacement used (LRU) replacement policy is used
	\end{itemize}

\end{parag}


\begin{parag}{Direct-Mapped cache}
    Consider now a \important{direct-mapped cache} with a \important{capacity of 128KiB} and \important{2 words per line}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The memory is word-addressed (one word = 4 bytes)
		\item The memory address has 32 bits
		\item Show how the address bits are used in the cache
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{parag}

\begin{parag}{Tag of a 2-Way Set-Associative}
	Finally, consider a \important{2 way set-associative cache} with a capacity of 128 KiB and \important{6<S-}
